# Let me introduce you to DisBot Ultra

Hey dear community,  
As promised, I have now come up with a premium version of DisBot ([Read](https://discord.com/channels/1084507523492626522/1163770374488592455/1291502042019397653)).

I can say that it will still take some time, because the bot is currently still too small for me to release something like this. So once again, a big thank you for over **100+ servers** and all your support for the bot!

I enjoy coding the bot every day and put my whole heart into it. When someone asks me, yes, coding DisBot takes time, but I want to invest that time. Even if DisBot is overkill, I want to learn from it, enjoy it and make you happy with it.

I also plan to include an option for voluntary support with DisBot Ultra. Even if you can donate, you don't get anything in return – and I always think carefully about this. That's why DisBot Ultra will be available in the future. I don't want to launch a premium bot that rips you off, but rather enable features that cost me extra, such as customer support or upcoming features that I pay for myself, so that DisBot finances itself – and I might be able to keep a small amount of money from it.

In addition, as attentive users have noticed, we have modified the logo a little bit to make everything look more modern and attractive. Thanks to **Lina** for the banner and the fine-tuning of the logo!

The website you are currently viewing is also new. And what follows a website? Exactly – the **dashboard**. I'm still thinking about how to design the best dashboard: either as standalone software with API (DisBot.COM) or something smaller with a bot instance and our database so that I can access all servers and data and conjure up a nice dashboard for you. I think it will be the former, but I'll see what makes the most sense and is the smartest.

Nevertheless, it will take a while, and the new **1.6.1 update** will come first. After that, we'll continue – our journey is far from over.

I hope I can keep making updates for a long time to come and continue doing exactly what I love (I know there are always breaks between updates so I can work on other things).

~ Cheers, **xyzjesper** and our team
